# Dealer Management System

This system is designed for dealerships, distributors, automotive workshops, and anyone who needs to manage vehicles and related services.

As part of our value proposition, we have developed an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** focused on vehicle inventory management and tracking the services performed on each vehicle. Users can log in to the application to add vehicles to the system, record the services performed, and track related information. Additionally, from a public interface, users can consult vehicle data by searching using the personal document number or vehicle license plate.

Currently, the application is targeted at the Argentine market, but future plans include adapting the web application to multiple languages and countries to expand its reach.
